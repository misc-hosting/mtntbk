# MTNTBK is a learner's manual for the art and science of Muay Thai.
Pick a section. Work on it during practice.

- You are viewing [MTNTBK.01](meta/change-log/#mtntbk01-spring-2022) which is very much in beta
  mode. Existing chapters are in progress, and have not yet been edited. Many more chapters and
chapter sections are coming soon! Check out the [Change Log](meta/change-log/) for the latest
updates.
- I wrote MTNTBK as a series of essays, from a learner's perspective. These are the things I
  **think** about, **visualize**, and later **practice**.
- Therefore, it is **not meant to be read linearly**. In the spirit of philosophical
  reflection: pick a concept or section, dwell on it, and extend it into your own practice.
- The MTNTBK will organized in five **major sections**, dedicated to [Knee and Clinch
  Techniques (Muay Khao)](muay-khao/), Kicks (Muay Tae), Punches (Muay Mat), Elbows (Muay Sok),
and Advanced Skills (Muay Femur).
- In addition to those, you will find several **minor sections**, on topics related to "Things
  I Wish I Knew Before Starting," [Training Philosophy](training-philosophy/), Equipment,
Library, and a few others.
