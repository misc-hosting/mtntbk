# MTNTBK is a learner's manual for the art and science of Muay Thai.
Pick a section. Work on it during practice.

- I wrote MTNTBK as a series of essays, from a learner's perspective. These are the things I
  **think** about, **visualize**, and later **practice**.
- Therefore, read it **not linearly**, but in the spirit of philosophical reflection: pick a
  concept or section, dwell on it, and extend it into your own experience.
- The MTNTBK is organized in five **major sections**, dedicated to Knee and Clinch Techniques
  (Muay Khao), Kicks (Muay Tae), Punches (Muay Mat), Elbows (Muay Sok), and Advanced Skills
(Muay Femur).
- In addition to those, you will find several **minor sections**, on topics related to "Things I
  Wish I Knew Before Starting," Training Foundations, Diet, Equipment, Library, and a few
others.
