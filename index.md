# MTNTBK is a learner's manual for the art and science of Muay Thai.
Pick a section. Work on it during practice.

- The notebook is not meant to be an exhaustive reference of every technique. Rather, I wrote
  it a series of essays, from a learner's perspective. These are the things I think about,
visualize, and later practice.
- I've organized the MTNTBK in five main sections, dedicated to Knee and Clinch Techniques
  (Muay Khao), Kicks (Muay Tae), Punches (Muay Mat), Elbows (Muay Sok), and Advanced Skills
(Muay Femur).
- In addition you will find several minor sections, dedicated to topics on training regiment,
diet, equipment, and a few others.
