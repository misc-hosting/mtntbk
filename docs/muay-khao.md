# Muay Khao (Knees and Clinch Style)

The art of Muay Khao emphasizes close-range techniques including clinch, knee and elbow
strikes, dumps, and sweeps. Muay Khao fighters tend to stalk, smother, and exhaust their
opponents with relentless forward pressure.

Muay Khao will favor an aggressive, taller fighter with good stamina and balance. Shorter Nak
Muays may be at a slight disadvantage when kneeing from the clinch. A taller Muay Khao will be
susceptible to a strong bottom game, losing exchanges at the lower center of gravity (dumps,
sweeps, or body locks). Whatever your body type, every position in the clinch has its answers.
Clinch fighters should therefore become familiar with common escapes and counter-movements, in
a way that allows them to flow between forms.

Knees get knockouts. Dominance in the clinch looks good. And nothing beats a skillfull sweep.
These techniques score highly, favored by audiences everywhere. But, although many fights end
up in the clinch for most of each round, clinch is rarely given the same priority as striking
during practice in the West. By contrast, Thai gyms include a regular clinch regiment in their
routine, where you can expect to see lengthy, low-key clinch grinding sessions as well as
high-intensity sparring rounds with hard falls.

When training the clinch, take proper safety precautions to minimize trauma, especially for
beginners. Side swipe the knees instead of direct, sharp hits. Assist landings when possible.
Indicate elbows at a quarter turn. More advanced practitioners will benefit from wearing elbow
and knee pads, though the Thais will often do without.

One common exercise involves "swimming" for dominant position. In another, a fighter's stamina
is tested by feeding them a string of fresh opponents, who exit the encounter at each
successful sweep (sometimes called, man-in-the-middle).

Since clinch work is essentially a type of stand-up grappling, a gym with a strong Judo or BJJ
program can borrow ideas, coaches, and ways of training from those sports to improve their Muay
Thai curriculum.

## Clinch

The clinch is meant to exhaust and tie up the opponent. It presents significant offensive and
defensive capabilities for those who practice it regularly. Those who do not, tend to panic and
tire quickly. Do not muscle in the clinch, outside of short bursts. It is rather a game of
balance, positional dominance, and explosive attacks.

Defensively, the clinch can be used to negate your opponent's favored offensive tools. It is
particularly effective in smothering tricky out-fighters, who would prefer to stay at range,
darting in and out with long straight punches, kicks, and spinning techniques. The clinch
forces the out-fighter to the inside, reducing advantages of speed and mobility. When stalked
to the ropes, the inexperienced out-fighter can drown under the pressure of Muay Khao's
relentless knees, elbows, and sweeps.

Dominant clinchers will push, drag, hang onto, and otherwise unbalance their opponent.
Recognizing these dominant positions allows the Muay Khao to rest in relative safety, while the
opponent expands significant energy trying to "muscle out" of the position. At the extreme, a
fading fighter can use the clinch to play for locked positions, stalling the game until a
referee's break.

Safety in the clinch comes also from controlling the opponents neck and arm positions, as well
as from "hiding" the head tightly over an opponent's shoulder (for a taller fighter) or tucking
into the chest, under the chin (for the shorter fighter). This lack of space prevents
significant strikes. From the locked position, explosive movement is used to create space
filled by knees and elbows.

Sudden changes in positional balance flows into a limited number of allowable sweeps, similar
in their dynamics to Judo sweeps such as the
[Deashi-harai](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/De-ashi-harai) (Forward Foot Sweep),
[Okuri-ashi-harai](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Okuri-ashi-harai) (Following Foot Sweep),
[Hiza-guruma](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Hiza-guruma) (Knee Wheel), or
[Harai-](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Harai-tsurikomi-ashi) and [Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi](
https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi) (Foot Sweeps).  For the rules on what
sweeps are allowed, see the Rules.

### Common Positions

Chest to chest. Collar tie. Head post. Fifty-fifty. 

Outside. Inside.

Top Control.
Bottom Control.

### Entry

So you like to clinch, but you get clipped on the way in. To get the fight into your preferred
zone of action, you must first pass through your opponent's offenses in the far, middle, and
close ranges. Safe entries and exits from the clinch must therefore be understood, visualized,
and practiced regularly in sparring.

Entries into the clinch can be chained from both your offensive and defensive
combos.

Consider for example the basic `one, two, three` boxing combo, with the three being your lead
hook. Instead of punching, the lead hook can be modified slightly to wrap around the opponent's
lead hand, or deeper into the position, around the neck. The combination then becomes `one,
two, hook clinch entry`. The entry is made safer by the opponent covering from the `jab, cross`.

Similarly, the clinch can be initiated on the defensive footing. For example, recall raising
your left elbow to "answer the phone" in response to your opponent's right hook. From that
position, lower your elbow and extend the arm to find yourself on the inside, in the clinch.

Whether on the offense or defense, understand that "naked" entry into the clinch is easily
avoided. It is also dangerous for you, because you are obviously moving forward. Instead, chain
the entry to flow smoothly at the end of your existing combinations. Have several such entries
ready at your disposal.

### Exit

Exit from the clinch is likewise dangerous for both fighters. In my gym, fighters often assume
their exits are completely covered by some sort of a mutual understanding to break apart and
recover.

Nothing can be further from the truth. The exit is a moment of extreme peril. You must
understand this to both do it safely and to create the maximum amount of disruption for your
opponent.

Safe exit for yourself often means taking a route around, and toward the back of your opponent,
ideally with a parting shot that reinforces the exit. Alternatively, coaches often teach a
forceful frontal forearm push away from the action, in which both fighters end up taking a step
back, again with a parting shot to cover.

Whatever the case, moments of separation are safest when your opponent is unbalanced and you
are not. Whenever possible, you should be the one "leading the dance" of positional dominance,
not the other way around.

In her podcast dedicated to the art of Muay Khao, Sylvie von Duuglas-Ittu recommends yo-yoing
between the entry and exit positions, which is particularly effective when fighting under
rulesets that discourage lengthy clinch engagements. In this way, you can enter the clinch,
attack, push out, attack, and then reengage rapidly to keep your opponent from ever settling.
Violent, unexpected collisions happen on the way in and out of the clinch range. This "catch
and release" dynamic creates a moment of false relief, at a time of extreme vulnerability for
your opponent. Exploit it to your advantage by always finishing your exits with an attack.
Treat the exit as part of a combination and train it purposefully.
