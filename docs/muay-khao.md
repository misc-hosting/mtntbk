# Muay Khao (Knees and Clinch Style)

The art of Muay Khao emphasizes close-range techniques including clinch, knee and elbow
strikes, dumps, and sweeps. Muay Khao fighters tend to stalk, smother, and exhaust their
opponents with relentless forward pressure.

Muay Khao will favor an aggressive, taller fighter with good stamina and balance. Shorter Nak
Muays may be at a slight disadvantage when kneeing from the clinch. A taller Muay Khao will be
susceptible to a strong bottom game, losing exchanges at the lower center of gravity (dumps,
sweeps, or body locks). Whatever your body type, every position in the clinch has its answers.
Clinch fighters should therefore become familiar with common escapes and counter-movements, in
a way that allows them to flow between forms.

Knees get knockouts. Dominance in the clinch looks good. And nothing beats a skillfull sweep.
These techniques score highly, favored by audiences everywhere. But, although many fights end
up in the clinch for most of each round, clinch is rarely given the same priority as striking
during practice in the West. By contrast, Thai gyms include a regular clinch regiment in their
routine, where you can expect to see lengthy, low-key clinch grinding sessions as well as
high-intensity sparring rounds with hard falls.

When training the clinch, take proper safety precautions to minimize trauma, especially for
beginners. Side swipe the knees instead of direct, sharp hits. Assist landings when possible.
Indicate elbows at a quarter turn. More advanced practitioners will benefit from wearing elbow
and knee pads, though the Thais will often do without.

One common exercise involves "swimming" for dominant position. In another, a fighter's stamina
is tested by feeding them a string of fresh opponents, who exit the encounter at each
successful sweep (sometimes called, man-in-the-middle).

Since clinch work is essentially a type of stand-up grappling, a gym with a strong Judo or BJJ
program can borrow ideas, coaches, and ways of training from those sports to improve their Muay
Thai curriculum.

## Clinch

Clinch can be an effective tool for both offense and defense.

Defensively, clinch can be used to negate your opponent's favored attacks. It is particularly
effective in smothering tricky out-fighters, who would prefer to stay at range, darting in and
out with long straight punches, kicks, and spinning techniques. The clinch forces the
out-fighter to the inside, reducing advantages of speed and mobility. When stalked to the
ropes, the inexperienced out-fighter can drown under the pressure of Muay Khao's relentless
knees, elbows, and sweeps.

Dominant clinchers will push, drag, hang onto, and otherwise unbalance their opponent.
Recognizing these dominant positions allows the Muay Khao to rest in relative safety, while the
opponent expands significant energy trying to "muscle out" of the position. At the extreme, a
fading fighter can use the clinch to play for locked positions, stalling the game until a
referee's break.

Safety in the clinch comes also from controlling the opponents neck and arm positions, as well
as from "hiding" the head tightly over an opponent's shoulder (for a taller fighter) or tucking
into the chest, under the chin (for the shorter fighter). This lack of space prevents
significant strikes. From the locked position, explosive movement is used to create space
filled by knees and elbows. Sudden changes in positional balance flows into a limited number of
allowable sweeps, similar in their dynamics to the "minor foot sweeps" in Judo such as the
Deashi Harai (Front Foot Sweep), Okuriashi Harai (Following Foot Sweep), or Harai Tsurikomi
Ashi (Lifting Pulling Foot Sweep).
