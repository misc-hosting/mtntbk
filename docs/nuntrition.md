My first piece of advice about nutrition is: Don't listen to me (or anybody else online).
*Everything* in this chapter should be discussed with your coach, your gym mates, your
physician, and probably your mom.

The second advice I can give you is to keep it simple. There are books and books written about
sport nutrition. Many of them are bullshit. If and when you feel lost revert to the basics:
(1) stay hydrated and (2) eat simple, fresh, whole foods in moderation.

Get a scale. Weight gains or losses come from paying careful attention to your body. You will
have to modify any diet and exercise plans to fit your body and lifestyle. Weight cutting or
any other drastic measures are best reserved for competitive athletes, who work under the
supervision of their coach and physician.

I do not want to write yet another nutrition book to confuse you. The following are rather a
few simple "rules of thumb" that have worked for me and that have reasonable support in
scientific literate.

## Food Before, During, or After Practice

## Hydration

The old Soviet manuals are adamant about not drinking water during practice. This idea makes a
lot of sense to me as well as being supported by the science.

The first thing to understand about hydration is dehydration. What is dehydration? According to
the Mayo Clinic: "Dehydration occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your
body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. If you don't
replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated." Signs of dehydration are not mysterious: they
include dry mouth and lips and viscous, yellow urine. Alternatively, the presence of saliva and
clear urine, usually means you are hydrated!

I have a few questions though: How much water reserve do I have during strenuous exercise?  How
long can I go without water? When is the best time to rehydrate? And, What liquid should drink
to rehydrate? Let's take these one at a time.

*How much water reserve do I have during strenuous exercise?*
