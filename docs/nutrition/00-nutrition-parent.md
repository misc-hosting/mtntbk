# Nutrition
{: .no_toc }

My first piece of advice about nutrition is: Don't listen to me (or anybody else online).
*Everything* in this chapter should be discussed with your coach, your gym mates, your
doctor, and probably your mom.

The second advice I can give you is to keep it simple. There are books and books written about
sport nutrition. Many of them are bullshit. If and when you feel lost revert to the basics:
(1) stay hydrated and (2) eat simple, fresh, whole foods in moderation.

Get a scale. Weight gains or losses come from paying careful attention to your body. You will
have to modify any diet and exercise plans to fit your body and lifestyle. Weight cutting or
any other drastic measures are best reserved for competitive athletes, who work under the
supervision of their coach and physician.

I do not want to write yet another nutrition book to confuse you. The following are rather a
few simple "rules of thumb" that have worked for me and that have reasonable support in
scientific literate.
