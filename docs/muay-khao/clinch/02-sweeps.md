### Sweeps Similarity to Judo

Sudden changes in positional balance flows into a limited number of allowable sweeps, similar
in their dynamics to Judo sweeps such as the
[Deashi-harai](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/De-ashi-harai) (Forward Foot Sweep),
[Okuri-ashi-harai](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Okuri-ashi-harai) (Following Foot Sweep),
[Hiza-guruma](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Hiza-guruma) (Knee Wheel), or
[Harai-](https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Harai-tsurikomi-ashi) and [Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi](
https://judo.ijf.org/techniques/Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi) (Foot Sweeps). For the rules on what
sweeps are allowed, see the Rules.
