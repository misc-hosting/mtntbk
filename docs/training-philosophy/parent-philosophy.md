# Training Philosophy
{: .no_toc }

Muay Thai can be super fun. And healthy. And challenging. And yes, it's a sport that can be
practiced as any other sport, Western Kickboxing or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Yet, it is also an
art, which carries with it a sense of a distinctive style and a way of thinking---a philosophy
of the body.

Of course, this way of life has its home in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. Today
it's also practiced in gyms all over the world: popular on its own merits and as one of the
pillars within the greater mixed martial arts movement. As a recipient of this tradition
outside of its homeland, I cannot claim some special, authoritative point of view on the art as
a whole. These are a student's observations, which I share with you in hopes of a common
starting point (and not an end) to a life-long discussion.
